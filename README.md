## Server Launch

### Requirements
- Docker
- Docker Compose

### Launch Commands

To start the server use:

```bash
docker compose up
```

To start in background mode:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

To stop the server:

```bash
docker compose down
```

### Fixing Permission Issues

If you encounter errors related to file configuration or log access permissions during startup, such as:

```
ERROR[Main]: Failed to open "/home/minetest/.minetest/debug.txt": Permission denied
ERROR[Main]: Could not read configuration from "/home/minetest/.minetest/minetest.conf"
```

Run the following command to fix access permissions:

```bash
sudo chmod -R 777 ./luanti_files
```

This command sets full access permissions (read/write/execute) to all files and directories inside `luanti_files`, allowing the Docker container to work freely with configuration, worlds, and mods.
